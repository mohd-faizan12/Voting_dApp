# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a Voting dApp & Hardhat use case. It comes with a Voting dApp contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell

# Compile the Smart contract running below command
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy the Smart contract running below command
npx hardhat run --network Sepolia scripts/deploy.js

#Run below command to run test script
npx hardhat test
